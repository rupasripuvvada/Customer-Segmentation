# Customer-Segmentation

Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project focuses on customer segmentation, an unsupervised machine learning task that groups customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. By applying clustering techniques, the project helps businesses better understand their customer base and create targeted marketing strategies.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing customer data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns, trends, and distributions in customer data.

Clustering Models: Implementing algorithms like K-Means to segment customers.

Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize clusters and insights.

Business Insights: Interpreting customer groups to suggest personalized marketing approaches and improved customer experience.

Tech Stack:

Python

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models (K-Means, scaling, evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook – Development & analysis environment

Outcomes:

Identifies meaningful customer groups (e.g., high-value, budget-conscious, occasional buyers).

Provides actionable insights for targeted marketing, customer retention, and product recommendations.
